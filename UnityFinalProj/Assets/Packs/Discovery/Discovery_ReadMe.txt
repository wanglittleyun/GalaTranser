'Discovery' Music Pack for Unity

Thanks for purchasing this music pack! These audio files are encoded in variable bit rate OggVorbis format, and will loop perfectly. 

Be sure the '3D Audio' option is deselected for the assets for proper playback. Also, if you intend to crossfade between any two of these tracks to achieve a smooth change in intensity, I have found it best to start playback of the new track with audio.volume=0, then set it's Time.samples to the other playing track, then begin the crossfade. It is also best to have the assets set to Stream From Disc so that sync between the two crossfading tracks is sample perfect, avoiding any phasing/doubling issues.

If this music works well as a placeholder, but you need something totally unique for your game, contact me. I can work with almost any budget and timeframe to deliver high quality, original music + sound to you. I also have extensive knowledge in implementing music + sound in Unity (custom scripting, etc). 

Lastly, when you ship your game, a heads up is appreciated if this music makes it in the final product. I proudly display all credits, and promote any game I'm a part of!

Enjoy!
